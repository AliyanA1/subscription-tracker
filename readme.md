# Subscription Management System (In Progress)

This project is all about building a **production-ready Subscription Management System** with:

- Real users
- Real money
- Real business logic

The goal is to create a backend that can securely handle subscriptions, payments, and user management for a real-world SaaS product.

## What Iâ€™m Learning and Building

- **JWT Authentication** â€“ Secure user login and token management.
- **Database Modeling** â€“ Designing schemas for users, subscriptions, and payments.
- **API Architecture** â€“ RESTful API design for handling subscriptions and workflows.
- **Security** â€“ Implementing best practices for authentication, authorization, and data protection.
- **Automated Workflows** â€“ Reminder systems, subscription renewals, and notifications.
- **Email Integration** â€“ Sending automated emails to users.

## Tech Stack

- **Node.js & Express** â€“ Backend server.
- **MongoDB** â€“ Database for users and subscriptions.
- **JWT** â€“ For authentication and session management.
- **Bcrypt** â€“ For secure password hashing.

## Status

ðŸš§ **This project is currently in development**.  
Iâ€™m actively working on:

- Authentication & Authorization
- Subscription APIs
- Reminder workflows & email sending

Stay tuned for updates as I progress through building this system into a fully production-ready backend!
